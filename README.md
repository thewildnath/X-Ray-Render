# X-Ray-Render

Written in Matlab, this was my final project at the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes 2015.
The algorithm simulates a radiographic table and an X-Ray emitter. For each pixel in the final image(each sensor on the table), it shoots a ray from the emitter to that pixel and intersects it with the volume that sits between.
The program was tested only using geometric shapes, but it should work similarly any shape.
